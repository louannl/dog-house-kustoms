# Dog House Kustoms Redesign
Original project: 
- JS & Jquery for navigation scroll
- HTML & CSS

Current Version:
- React
- CSS, using react modules and CSSTransition for animations.

Comments: 
Tailwind made it a lot easier to quickly style elements in my other projects.

## Known Issues
- Mobile screen - centered content 
I've noticed in Chrome the styling on smaller screens doesn't position the content in the center, while firefox does. 

- Mobile screen - scroll
Because I expand the navigation to take up the viewport height on mobile this pushes content down - at current, when using the nav-links, it won't position the user in the correct place because of this. I can fix this. 

- Styling Iframe (google map) dynamically
I can't. I can either look at an alternative to an iframe or figure out how to get the styling working with css modules. 

## Media queries blank copy (Switched to mobile first)
@media only screen and (min-width: 640px) {}

@media only screen and (min-width: 768px) {}

@media only screen and (min-width: 1024px) {}

@media only screen and (min-width: 1536px) {}
